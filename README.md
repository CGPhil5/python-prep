# Python Prep

The program ``pythonprep.py`` is an exercise for students. It is a Python
exercise designed to test some basic Python skills. Our training course
includes Python programming and the student needs to be able to program in it.

To run your program at the command line, type:

```bash
python pythonprep.py 
```

If you're running in the Leap IDE simply click the green triangle in the top
right.

There are three parts to this review assignment.

## Exercise 1

The function `exercise_1` requires the student to add up the numbers provided
in the list S. This must be done using a for-loop, and the sum should be
returned by the function.

## Exercise 2

The function `exercise_2` requires the student to add up the numbers provided
in the list S *using at most two lines of code*. The sum should be returned by
the function.

## Exercise 3

The function `exercise_3` requires the student to create a dictionary with the
months of the year as keys and the number of days in each month as the values.
Keys should be the first 3 letters of the month and in all capital letters. For
example, `JAN` for January. The dictionary should be returned by the function.
