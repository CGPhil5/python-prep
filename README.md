# Python Prep

The program ``pythonprep_assignment.py`` is an exercise for students.
It is a Python exercise designed to test some basic Python skills.
Our training course includes Python programming and the student needs to be
able to program in it.

There are two small code changes that you need to make. First, add code 
to define a list containing the names of the  months in a year. Please use 
three-character month names, like "Jan" for January.  Please call it "months".

Then, add code to define a dictionary containing the days of the
month for your current year. Please use three-character month names, like
"Jan" for "January". Please call it "days".

After these two additions, the program computes the number of months in a year
which have 30 days.

To run your program at the command line, 

```bash
python pythonprep_assignment.py
```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

You have 
successfully completed the exercise when you are able to see output showing 
a total of 4.
